# Hostel Chain Booking and Payment System

This is a smart contract that allows hostels and hotels to accept crypto payments and issue a receipt in the form of an NFT. Currently it is configured to accept USDC on the Polygon blockchain. This can be expanded in the future.

## Current Features

* Accepts payment for stay
* Issues NFT to customer with information about their booking
* Checks availability of room/dates before issuing NFT

## Future Features

* Admin layer for hostel to control price, issue cancellation, etc.
* NFT could directly serve as a key to room and facilities
* NFT is "Living Receipt" that gets updated as customer purchases extras (i.e. Customer books an hour in the gym directly through the contract)
* Expand to different blockchains and payment methods beyond USDC
